I think printer.cfg is the real one, not custom.cfg.

TODO:
* Maybe manual Z calibration (dimensional accuracy)?  Would probably have to redo advanced delta calibration
* Maybe resonance compensation?  Resonance doesn't actually seem too bad

30mm -> 0.6 

Stuff seems to work well, printed a spare carriage.  Still slight blobbing on corners, and holes don't quite connect to the perimeteres around them -- underextruding?  Holes are shrinking?  Is 205 too cold?

Bumped max_accel from 3000 to 6000, still work? yeah, looks about the same (44:56)

max_accel to 8000, and print at 170 mm/s (85 for walls) ->

Freq estimate 50hz, but very little visible.

I think the Bowden tube is 750mm long.
