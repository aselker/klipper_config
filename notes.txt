printer.cfg is the current config.  custom.cfg is old / I never have used it.

hostname is raspberrypi, username pi, password qwerty123.

TODO:
* Maybe manual Z calibration (dimensional accuracy)?  Would probably have to redo advanced delta calibration

30mm -> 0.6 

Stuff seems to work well, printed a spare carriage.  Still slight blobbing on corners, and holes don't quite connect to the perimeteres around them -- underextruding?  Holes are shrinking?  Is 205 too cold?

Bumped max_accel from 3000 to 6000, still work? yeah, looks about the same (44:56)

max_accel to 8000, and print at 170 mm/s (85 for walls) ->

Freq estimate 50hz, but very little visible.

I think the Bowden tube is 750mm long.

TODO:
* Retune pressure advance
* Use a Sharpie to get an actual print-area shape
* Print a spare extruder in case I melt mine

X: 1.58mm
Y: 2.7 or 2.8?
100 mm/s, so that's 63.3 Hz or 36.4 Hz

Tried resonance compensation / input shaping, but it didn't seem to do much.

After shimming both ends of the Bowden tube, I redid a pressure-advance tower, but it was hard to tell where was ideal.  Arbitrarily brought pressure advance down from 0.6 to 0.25.
